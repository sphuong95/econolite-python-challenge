Write a Python 3 program that takes 2 arguments:

The first argument is the path to a directory that contains INI files describing features of different breeds of cats,
where each INI files contains one section that is the name of the breed, and that section contains key-value pairs,
where each key is the name of a feature of that breed, and the value description of that feature.

The second argument is the name of one of these features.

The program must print the description of the given feature for each breed, in the format of "<Breed Name>: <Feature Description>".


For example, executing "your_program.py ./example hairLength" should print:

Russian Blue: short
Persian: long


The INI files need not contain all of the feature descriptions. For example, in the above example,
the output does not contain a line for the Siamese breed because that INI file does not contain a "hairLength" feature.


You may use the example directory provided to test your program, but you should also create your own files to test against as well.
Bundle your test files with your program when delivering it.

Ideally, your program can gracefully handle bad input, such as invalid INI files in the directory.
